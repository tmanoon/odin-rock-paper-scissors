Honestly, it took me a few hours to understand and calculate how exactly I want my code to look and function each time.
I have not noticed a few syntax mistakes because two mosquitos distracted me while I was writing the code.
I ate lunch and it really hekped me to think about the additional variable 'equality' in order to know how to treat it when both selections were the same.
I hope you like my code.
